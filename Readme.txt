Project Name: chess AI game
 
It is the course project of 'Java Programming (in English)' and it aims to realize a program in which user is able to enjoy the fun of playing chess with AI. The course project, as well as the course, received full marks.
 
This program includes two sections. One is to design the Java GUI and implement the rule of chess, and the other is the AI algorithm. I designed special interface for promotion and hint for access position of the selected chess piece, in order to make it a user-friendly program. I realized a 'Negamax searching with Alpha-Beta pruning' algorithm for AI. With the smart design of evaluation of chessboard, AI performs well with fast speed.
